# Ecom-Pro-E-Commerce-Product-Management-System

Designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and JPA/Hibernate, with MySQL as the database (initially H2 for testing).
Developed CRUD functionalities and custom JPA queries for product search (filter by name, brand, description, category).
Managed image handling by implementing file upload and retrieval with Lob (BLOBs), streamed as response data.
Integrated backend APIs with a React.js frontend (Vite, Axios, Bootstrap), ensuring smooth interaction via CORS and applying OOP, Collections, and Exception Handling in service logic.
